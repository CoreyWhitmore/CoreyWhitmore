Corey Whitmore

Full-Stack Software Developer

I'm a full-stack developer who's been interested in programming and software for a long time, ever since I taught myself JavaScript when I was in High School. I love solving problems and seeing a project come together. My strongest languages are JavaScript and C#, but I also know several others, including Java, C++, and Python. I've worked with Vue 2 and I’m excited to learn Vue 3. I’m very organized and detail-oriented, I enjoy math and science, and I like working in a well-ordered and structured environment.
